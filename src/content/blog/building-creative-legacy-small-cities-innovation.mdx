Two years ago, I watched a shy intern from Lethbridge Polytechnic’s VXR program present a virtual safety training module to industry leaders at the START Centre. Her confidence grew with every slide, and by the end, she was fielding questions like a pro. That moment crystallized why I invest in Lethbridge’s creative ecosystem: small cities like ours aren’t just nurturing talent—they’re redefining innovation. As the founder of Coalbanks Creative, I’ve spent over 20 years blending video production, digital strategy, and entrepreneurship to build a legacy here. Through education, mentorship, and collaboration, I’m proving that small centers can lead global creative trends. Here’s how Lethbridge is doing it—and how you can too.

## Shaping the Future: Advising and Teaching at Lethbridge Polytechnic

My role on Lethbridge Polytechnic’s industry advisory panel lets me shape programs like Digital Communications and Media (DCM) to meet the creative industry’s demands. Three times a year, I speak to DCM and other classes, sharing lessons from my journey as an educator, creative, and entrepreneur. These sessions aren’t lectures—they’re dialogues. Students pitch ideas, like using AI for video editing, pushing me to stay sharp while I guide them toward practical skills.

For business owners, this work ensures a pipeline of talent ready to elevate your projects. For creatives, it’s a reminder that teaching sharpens your craft. One example: my input on the Virtual and Augmented Reality (VXR) program helped align it with real-world needs, like VR training tools at the Spatial Technologies Applied Research and Training (START) Centre. Seeing students turn concepts into community solutions shows why education is the bedrock of innovation.

## Igniting Dialogue: Speaking at Conferences and Panels

Speaking at the High Level Innovation Conference and START Centre’s XR, VR, and AR panels lets me spark ideas across Lethbridge’s tech and creative scenes. At the START Centre, I’ve explored projects like VR training for dementia caregivers, merging technology with storytelling. At the conference, I’ve argued that small cities like Lethbridge outpace urban hubs in innovation speed. Why? Our tight-knit community turns ideas into action fast—collaborations form over coffee, not months of emails.

During one panel, I claimed Lethbridge could rival bigger cities in creative tech if we lean into our strengths: connection and agility. For community stakeholders, this is a call to take pride in our potential. For professionals, it’s inspiration to engage locally. These platforms show that dialogue isn’t just talk—it’s the spark for progress.

## Mentoring the Next Generation: A Ripple Effect

Mentorship is where I see legacy take shape, especially through internships at Coalbanks Creative. Hosting students from the University of Lethbridge and Lethbridge Polytechnic isn’t just about extra help—it’s a strategic move with hidden benefits. Interns bring fresh ideas, like a new drone footage workflow that saved us hours. They connect us to local organizations, strengthening community ties. And they create a talent pipeline—some return as employees or refer others, building our network.

The ripple effect is even bigger. Interns apply their skills to local projects, like a VXR student’s virtual safety training for the Alberta Construction Safety Association, showcased at the START Centre. This boosts Lethbridge’s creative scene, attracting clients who value our community focus. For business owners, internships drive ROI: a skilled workforce means better projects and growth. For creatives, mentoring hones your leadership. And for stakeholders, it’s social mobility—students from diverse backgrounds gain opportunities, diversifying our industry.

Research backs this: internships increase employability by 12.6% (ScienceDirect) and help 79.9% of interns land jobs (Future Business Journal). In Lethbridge, these stats mean a stronger economy and tighter community. One intern’s growth—from nervous to confident—reminds me why I do this: mentorship builds more than careers; it builds futures.

## Why Small Cities Lead the Way

Lethbridge’s creative and tech scene—fueled by the START Centre, STEM Fusion, and our universities—proves small cities can lead. My work advising, speaking, and mentoring shows that every connection here amplifies impact. A single intern’s project can spark a partnership; a panel can inspire a startup. This agility lets us outmaneuver bigger hubs, positioning Lethbridge as a global creative contender.

For creatives, small cities offer a playground for bold ideas. For business owners, they’re a source of talent and loyalty. For stakeholders, they’re a point of pride. Lethbridge’s edge lies in its intimacy—here, innovation isn’t a buzzword; it’s personal.
